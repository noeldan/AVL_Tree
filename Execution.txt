AVL Tree
---------------------
The AVL tree program has 2 program files. 
"avl.cpp" and "avl.h"

"avl-out" is the executable file.

input.txt file contains the node data.
output.txt file will constantly update the progress.
sample-output.txt file contains sample output data.


Compiling the program:
----------------------
prompt$ g++ -o avl-out avl.cpp

The above command compiles the program.
Output "avl-out" will be created on successful compilation.

(For faster execution purposes the command "g++ avl.cpp" can be used.
In which case "a.out" will be the executable file.)


Executing the program:
----------------------
prompt$ ./avl-out

The above command executes the program.


Output:
--------
On Execution the output will be displayed as below.

***************************************************


Select from the available options:
----------------------------------

1. Create Tree - Deletes the existing tree and creates a new tree with inputs from "input.txt" file.
2. Insert Data - Inserts data node to the existing tree.
3. Delete Data - Deletes data node from the existing tree.
4. Search - Searches the given data node and displayes the height on the data.
5. Traversal - Performs Pre-Order, Post-Order and In-Order traversals of the AVL tree.
6. Delete Tree - Deletes the entire tree.
7. Check Balance - Performs a balance check on the AVL tree and displays the height difference.
8. Exit - Exits from the program and returns to the
